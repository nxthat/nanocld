## ‚ùì What is nanocld ?

Nanocld, stand for `Nano Cloud Daemon` and it's a lie because you will be able to create big ones. <br />
I see it as an open source [Hybrid Cloud Orchestrator](https://docs.next-hat.com/docs/guides/nanocl/overview) ! <br />
To help orchestrate `containers` and `virtual machines` on multiple hosts. <br />
It provides basic mechanisms for deployment, maintenance, and scaling. <br />
You will be able to create an your own `Hybrid Cloud` with optional `Vpn` and `Dns` controllers. <br />
Deploying your `applications` and `servers` behind a `Vpn` as never been that easy !

Builds upon `Rust` to have the best performance and a smallest footprint. <br />
It's use the best ideas and practices from the community. <br />
You can build an entire CI/CD pipeline from `tests` to `high availability production`. <br />
See it as a `Kubernetes` alternative with more `features` and a `network security layer`.

This repository is the `DAEMON` version you can see the `CLI` [here](https://github.com/nxthat/nanocl).
